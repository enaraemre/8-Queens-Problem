Write a program that uses the genetic algorithm to solve 8 queens problem.

Implement:

 8-digit, integer-value genome,

 the fitness function of the form:

*f(configuration) = 28ô€€€number_of_attacks(configuration);

-the genetic operators

} roulette wheel selection,

} two-site crossover,

} mutation

Experiment with the size of population and the probability of mutation (roughly speaking that probability should be low).

In order to have working application genomes amount should be even number.
